## *Lan*d*s*cap*e* Su*r*rogate: Learning Decision Losses for Mathematical Optimization Under Partial Information

We are introducing *LANCER*, a versatile framework designed to tackle challenging optimization problems, such as those found in nonlinear combinatorial problems, smart predict+optimize framework, etc.

## What is in this release?

This release contains our implementation of LANCER and its application to 1) learning surrogates for mixed-integer nonlinear programming (**MINLP**) and; 2) smart Predict+Optimize (a.k.a. decision-focused learning or **DFL**), but it can also be applied to a range of other large-scale optimization problems, such as hyper-parameter optimization, model-based reinforcement learning, etc.

### 0. Setup

Please follow the steps in [installation.md](./installation.md) to setup the environment.

### 1. Applying LANCER for MINLP

[MINLP/README.md](./MINLP/README.md) contains instructions to validate LANCER for MINLP tasks. We evaluate on two benchmarks: Stochastic Shortest Path and Combinatorial Portfolio Optimization/Selection with 3rd order objective. 

### 2. Applying LANCER for DFL

[DFL/README.md](./DFL/README.md) contains instructions to validate LANCER for DFL tasks. We evaluate on three benchmarks: Shortest Path, Multidimensional Knapsack and Portfolio Optimization/Selection.
